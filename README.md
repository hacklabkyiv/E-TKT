E-TKT is a DIY label maker that mixes both old fashioned and contemporary technology to create something as simple as... Labels!

<br>

# ü§î why?
### *TLDR: curiosity, technical challenge and of course organizing stuff.*

![motex3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15098003/171213081-fbdf82dc-e752-46eb-81d8-d3f7b8e25f01.png)

The initial spark for this project came from an ordinary manual [labeling device](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256801648218535.html) that I bought to organize my workshop. I was ***VERY UPSET*** when I noticed that it was basically rubbish, getting broken and unusable after just a few operations. This little plastic hook (circled in red) grabs a gated cog (the white plastic part below) to feed the tape forward. I tried to fix and reinforce it, but the failure was unavoidable because there seems to be a critical flaw in the project: it is too weak for the lateral resistance imposed.

![low_DSC8695 copy annotated](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15098003/171303466-703fb695-e1d0-488c-8f9b-58dd55291529.jpg)

I knew I could easily buy a brand new modern electronic thermal label printer ([such as Brother](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/pth110bp)), but something about the vintage embossed finish fascinated me. Also, these new models use expensive [proprietary cartridges](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/tze335) that create a lot of trash after use.

After all, even though the pressing mechanism was poorly made, the characters' carousel was pretty sturdy and sharp. So I thought: can I build over its principles to create a functional device? If so, then why not make it *physical-digital?*

...why bother mixing an archaic printing method with current automation and connectivity features? Because *why not?* It was a technological blind spot to be explored!

<br>

# *...anachronism* ü§ì
I've later realized that it was what I‚Äôve been attracted to. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism):
> ‚ÄúAn ***anachronism*** (from the Greek ·ºÄŒΩŒ¨ ana, 'against' and œáœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ khronos, 'time') is a chronological inconsistency in some arrangements, especially a juxtaposition of people, events, objects, language terms and customs from different time periods‚Äù.

### The point is: even though the process is digitalized, *the resulting label is totally old school* and there is no easy way of telling if it wasn't made in the traditional way.

<br>

# ‚öôÔ∏è how does it work?
![how](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15098003/171194737-37861a1f-fba7-404c-b987-5b3d26e704f3.png)

An *ESP32* commands the label production and also serves an on demand web application to any device connected in a local network.

***Neither internet is needed, nor installing any app.***

The whole process of connecting the E-TKT machine to a local network and then launching the app is aided by a small *OLED display* that provides instructions and a dynamically generated *QR code* with the *URL*, according to the IP attributed by the WLAN.

The *web app* provides text validation, special characters, a preview of the exact size of the tape, an option to select the desired lateral margins and also real-time feedback during the printing (also present on the device screen). There are also commands for attaching a new reel, manually feeding and cutting the tape.

The label production itself uses the same mechanical principles as the original machine did, but is now automated. A stepper motor feeds the tape while another selects the appropriate character on the carousel according to a home position acquired by hall sensor. Then a servo motor imprints each character by pressing the carousel to the tape. That happens successively until the end of the desired content, when there is a special character position to cut the label. A light blinks to ask for the label to be picked.

![Schematic_e-tkt_2022-05-30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15098003/171064999-262a4c68-01ae-4122-8584-5d784ebf6408.png)

### Power
  - *7-12v* to be provided by an external power supply with at least 35w to deal with servo peaks current while pressing the label. It supplies the stepper drivers directly.
  - *6v* out of the L7806 step down and is provided for both the servo and hall sensor.
  - *3.3v* is provided by the ESP32 WROOM board (as in its logical ports).

### Logic Level
- As the ESP32 uses 3.3v logic, we need this conversion for parts that are running on higher voltage (servo and hall sensor).

### Press
- The servo uses 6v, higher voltages tend to damage it.

### Carousel
- NEMA stepper, driver and a hall sensor to match the position origin.

### Wifi reset
- A tact button that when pressed while booting, clears the saved credentials.

### Feeder
- Reduced stepper motor along with its standard driver.

### User interface
- Running on 3.3v an I¬≤C OLED display and two LEDs (no need for resistors).

<br>

# üßµ 3D printing
